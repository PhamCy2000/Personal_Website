# About Me


Hello there, I'm Sean. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm a Mechanical Engineer by training, a problem-solver by nature, and a creator at heart. Having graduated from a top UK university, I was trained to see the world through a lens of systems, structures, and precision. This site is where I document my journey as I apply that engineering mindset to my passions in the digital world and beyond.

### From CAD to Code

My fascination with design didn't stop at Computer-Aided Design (CAD). I found that programming offered a different, yet equally powerful, toolkit for creation. Whether I'm writing scripts in Python to automate a task or delving into the fundamentals with C, I find immense satisfaction in building elegant solutions from the ground up.

This naturally extends to my passion for 3D modelling, where I get to shape ideas into visually compelling forms, much like sculpting with digital clay.

### Beyond the Screen and Schematics

When I'm not working on a project or writing code, I believe in leading a balanced life full of varied interests.

* **Chess:** I'm a keen chess player and find the game to be a beautiful exercise in strategy and foresight. I often stream my games and analyse them to improve.
* **Badminton:** For a more physical challenge, I enjoy the fast-paced, strategic nature of badminton.
* **Travel:** My greatest source of inspiration comes from travelling. Exploring new cultures and landscapes fuels my creativity and provides the subjects for my photography, which I hope you'll enjoy on this site.
* **Music:** And when it's time to unwind, youâ€™ll often find me quietly strumming my guitar.

This website is a work in progress, much like my own skills. I'm always eager to learn and connect with like-minded people. Feel free to browse my [blog](/blog/) or have a look at my latest [projects](/portfolio&projects/).

Thanks for stopping by.
