# POV: Choosing a Fridge with mum as an engineer


### *“You’re a mechanical engineer graduate, you should know how to pick the best fridge for us.”*

My mum nagged over WhatsApp. The notification pinged — she had just sent me a bunch of photos, each showing a refrigerator with a price tag. Most were on clearance sales at a local wholesaler, in her usual afternoon shop-browsing session.

As a mechanical engineering graduate, yes... I could recall some technical bits about how a fridge works — **heat pumps, R134a refrigerants, fins, compressors**, and all that jazz.

But that’s not what a middle-aged Asian woman cares about. With a fixed budget, her main concerns were simple:

*- “Can this fridge fit nicely in the kitchen?”*  
*- “Got enough space for my groceries?”*  
*- “Nice or not?”*

After some *mum-and-son debate*, I realised the deciding factors were quite different from what an engineer would normally consider.

### What Mum Cares About

* **Aesthetic:** *French-door design for sure.* (Yes, I only found out this year that’s what you call the double-door type.) Metallic coating, clean lines — she’s all about that polished look.  
* **Compartment Volume:** *“Large but not too large.”* That’s why she insists on visiting physical stores — to open and close every door herself. According to **Electrolux**, French-door fridges range from **350 to 600 litres**.  
* **Overall Size:** Width × Height × Depth — the fridge must slide perfectly into its *territory* in her kitchen.

### What I (Finally) Convinced Her to Consider

* **Energy Efficiency:** Look for the sticker with more stars ⭐, as the fridge runs 24/7, so efficiency matters a lot! 
* **Refrigerant Type:** Back in university, I learned about **R134a**, a common refrigerant used in fridges and air-cons. It works, but it’s not environmentally friendly. Nowadays, the greener choice is **R600a (isobutane)**, which is **primarily replacing R134a in household refrigerators and freezers**.  
* **Operating Noise:** Anything below **40 dB** is considered quiet — less humming, more peace to the house.
* **Improved Cooling Technology:** Every brand has its own fancy name — *LG’s LinearCooling™*, *Panasonic’s PrimeFresh™*, *Samsung’s Twin Cooling Plus™*. Most even come with **UV sterilisation** to kill bacteria and keep food fresher longer.

### Explaining a Refrigerator to my mum 

The simplest form of a refrigerator is the **vapour-compression refrigeration cycle** — four steps that repeat over and over:

**Compression → Condensation → Expansion → Evaporation.**

As food goes in,  heat loss starts to happen through convection/radiation, the heat are absorbed by the refrigerants which flow within the cooling coils in the fridge, resulting in an temperature increase of the refrigerant through conduction from the cooling coils.

#### Compression
The refrigerant passes through the **compressor**, where its pressure and temperature rises further, the *superheating* process, which can occur **before or during compression**, resulting in a **superheated vapour** at the compressor outlet.  
This hot gas then travels through the **external coils**, releasing heat into the room air.

#### Condensation & Expansion
Now that heat are removed, the refrigerant is then cooled and **condensed from vapour to liquid** in the **condenser** — that’s its key purpose before the next phase.  
Afterward, it passes through an **expansion valve**, where its pressure drops sharply, preparing it to absorb heat again.

#### Evaporation
The cooled refrigerant circulates inside the **evaporator coils**, pulling heat from your food and lowering the fridge’s internal temperature.

And the cycle repeats.
In thermodynamics, engineers model this as the **Reversed Rankine Cycle**, an idealised version of how real-world fridges work.

### Some cool tech I found!

* **Dual Compressor:** Separate cooling systems for the freezer and fridge help maintain ideal humidity and temperature levels — found in brands like **Bosch**.  
* **Magnetocaloric Cooling:** Uses materials like **gadolinium**, which heat or cool under a magnetic field — a phenomenon known as the **magnetocaloric effect**. It’s still **experimental for commercial fridges**, but represents a **cutting-edge direction** in energy-efficient refrigeration.  
* **AI & IoT Smart Fridges:** These can **recognise food items** with cameras, **suggest recipes**, and automatically **adjust humidity and temperature** to keep ingredients fresh. Some even remind you when your milk’s about to expire (and no, I’m not kidding).
* **Knock-Knock to see what you have** A very unique feature offered by Life Good (LG), allowing you to check what's in your fridge without opening the fridge door which affect the interior environment, see figure below:

### The Final Pick

After all the back-and-forths, and a few *“I told you so”* moments, we settled on a **Samsung refrigerator** — not because of its cutting-edge tech, nor its fancy cooling buzzwords, but honestly… because **it was on promo with Touch ’n Go E-Wallet cashback** that month, and it just feels "right", big enough compartment, sterilisation feature, and satisfying design...

Practical, efficient, and mum-approved.
