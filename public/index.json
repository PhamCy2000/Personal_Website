As a mechanical engineering graduate, yes‚Ä¶ I could recall some technical bits about how a fridge works ‚Äî heat pumps, R134a refrigerants, fins, compressors, and all that jazz. But that‚Äôs not what a middle-aged Asian woman cares about. With a fixed budget, her main concerns were simple: - ‚ÄúCan this fridge fit nicely in the kitchen?‚Äù - ‚ÄúGot enough space for my groceries?‚Äù - ‚ÄúNice or not?‚Äù After some mum-and-son debate, I realised the deciding factors were quite different from what an engineer would normally consider.

A self-drawn sketch of a reversed Rankine Cycle As food goes in, heat loss starts to happen through convection/radiation, the heat are absorbed by the refrigerants which flow within the cooling coils in the fridge, resulting in an temperature increase of the refrigerant through conduction from the cooling coils. Compression The refrigerant passes through the compressor, where its pressure and temperature rises further, the superheating process, which can occur before or during compression, resulting in a superheated vapour at the compressor outlet. This hot gas then travels through the external coils, releasing heat into the room air. Condensation \u0026 Expansion Now that heat are removed, the refrigerant is then cooled and condensed from vapour to liquid in the condenser ‚Äî that‚Äôs its key purpose before the next phase. Afterward, it passes through an expansion valve, where its pressure drops sharply, preparing it to absorb heat again. Evaporation The cooled refrigerant circulates inside the evaporator coils, pulling heat from your food and lowering the fridge‚Äôs internal temperature. And the cycle repeats. In thermodynamics, engineers model this as the Reversed Rankine Cycle, an idealised version of how real-world fridges work.
