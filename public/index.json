It‚Äôs a mechatronic prototype built with a stepper motor, micro-LIDAR TOF sensor, and an Arduino-based PID control system, with key parts made using additive manufacturing. The system was tested in a Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid under a controlled, risk-assessed environment to validate its performance and safety. Video We wanted a system that small research teams could actually use ‚Äî not just admire from afar. Our design goals were straightforward: üí∞ Affordable enough for student or lab projects. üß† Driver-in-the-loop ‚Äî let a real person sit in the seat and brake naturally. üîß Flexible ‚Äî handle both straight-line and corner braking. The idea was to blend robot precision with human feel, so testing on real roads becomes safe and practical.

We tried something different ‚Äî we pushed from the side. This sideways actuation freed up legroom, made it easier for a driver to stay in the seat, and reduced the need for heavy frames. It‚Äôs a small shift, but it changes everything about how the system fits in the car. We built a prototype using recycled aluminium and 3D-printed parts ‚Äî about 90% reused materials. It cost less than half our budget and still performed well in tests.

Most small teams can‚Äôt afford high-end robots, so they skip the real data. We wanted to change that ‚Äî to make meaningful research possible without million-dollar setups. When cost isn‚Äôt the bottleneck, creativity flows.

We made do with what we had ‚Äî aluminium offcuts, 3D-printed joints, and a secondhand actuator. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it worked. A few key lessons: Focus on response speed, not brute force. Always include manual override. Safety first. Don‚Äôt design in a vacuum ‚Äî talk, test, tweak. We had delays, parts that didn‚Äôt fit, and sensors that failed, but every setback taught us something. The project became less about the robot, more about learning how to think and work like engineers.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I‚Äôm a Mechanical Engineer by training, a problem-solver by nature, and a creator at heart. Having graduated from a top UK university, I was trained to see the world through a lens of systems, structures, and precision. This site is where I document my journey as I apply that engineering mindset to my passions in the digital world and beyond.

I found that programming offered a different, yet equally powerful, toolkit for creation. Whether I‚Äôm writing scripts in Python to automate a task or delving into the fundamentals with C, I find immense satisfaction in building elegant solutions from the ground up. This naturally extends to my passion for 3D modelling, where I get to shape ideas into visually compelling forms, much like sculpting with digital clay.
