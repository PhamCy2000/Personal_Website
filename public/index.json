Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I’m a Mechanical Engineer by training, a problem-solver by nature, and a creator at heart. Having graduated from a top UK university, I was trained to see the world through a lens of systems, structures, and precision. This site is where I document my journey as I apply that engineering mindset to my passions in the digital world and beyond.

I found that programming offered a different, yet equally powerful, toolkit for creation. Whether I’m writing scripts in Python to automate a task or delving into the fundamentals with C, I find immense satisfaction in building elegant solutions from the ground up. This naturally extends to my passion for 3D modelling, where I get to shape ideas into visually compelling forms, much like sculpting with digital clay.

Chess: I’m a keen chess player and find the game to be a beautiful exercise in strategy and foresight. I often stream my games and analyse them to improve. Badminton: For a more physical challenge, I enjoy the fast-paced, strategic nature of badminton. Travel: My greatest source of inspiration comes from travelling. Exploring new cultures and landscapes fuels my creativity and provides the subjects for my photography, which I hope you’ll enjoy on this site. Music: And when it’s time to unwind, you’ll often find me quietly strumming my guitar. This website is a work in progress, much like my own skills. I’m always eager to learn and connect with like-minded people. Feel free to browse my blog or have a look at my latest projects. Thanks for stopping by.
